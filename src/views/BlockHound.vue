        <h2>BlockHound</h2>
        <h4>Inspired by the neighborhood app NextDoor, I wanted to build an app that helps track your dogs movements. Everyday NextDoor is riddled with posts about losts dogs with vague descriptions and locations. I have created an app that can track your dogs movements, alerts you if your dog escapes, and can notfy nearby neighbors with your dogs description and real-time location.<img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/21/21645.png" height="19px"></h4>
