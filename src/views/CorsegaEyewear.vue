        <h2 style="color:red;">An Entrepreneurial Venture</h2>
        <h4>The idea came to me right after I overpaid for a pair of sunglasses during a trip to Barcelona, Spain in the summer of 2013. I analyzed the glasses on the balcony of my hostel and became really intrigued about what the net cost of producing sunglasses were. After learning the cost and profit margins that are typically associated with the eyewear industry, I decided to start my own company. After a year of research and development, <a style="color:red;">Corsega Eyewear</a> was born July, 2014.

        <h2 style="color:red;">A Proud Accomplishment</h2>
        <h4>Once the online store became live, I marketed my sunglasses online through social media and paid advertising. I took direct lessons from my Digital Marketing classes and applied them to my real time business project. I soon found strategies and techniques that were much more efficient than others, such as Search Engine Optimization (SE0) vs. Search Engine Marketing (SEM). My sunglasses were also being sold through boutiques throughout the San Francisco and Petaluma area. I reached profitability within 11 months and ran the company for another two years before shutting it down and relocating to the Sacramento area.

        <!-- I learned photoshop, photography, content marketing, advertisement construction, web development and branding. In 2014, after a year in development, I launched Corsega Eyewear! Corsegas had polarized, Revo coated lenses that popped with color, housed in a matte black, wayfarer style classic frame. I sold them through my website and boutiques around San Francisco. I reached profitability in less than a year. I received orders for them all over the United States, even Mexico and Australia. I solely ran this company for three years before selling it and moving away from the bay area. -->
